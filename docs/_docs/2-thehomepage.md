Whenever you run the dream journal, the homepage will appear. The homepage will be at the address `0.0.0.0:8080/`, alternatively: `127.0.0.1:8080/` or just `localhost:8080/`. The homepage is the base page that lists all your dreams. It should look something like this:

The homepage has two main sections. On the left side, the dreams are listed with the newest ones first. If you have just installed the journal, the left side will just be blank. On the right side, you will see a white bar. The white bar is the "actions bar" which lists actions such as: `Create a new dream`, `Search` and `Filter`. Each dream has its own page that you will be able to access from the homepage.

## The Actions Bar
Now that you know where the actions bar is located, we will go over the three main options:
* **Create a new dream**: this button brings you to the dream creation editor
* **Search**: this is a simple keyword search feature that allows you to find dreams by searching for words in their titles or content
* **Filter**: here you can filter dreams by tags, characters, locations and dream types.
