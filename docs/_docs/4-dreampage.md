In the previous page we learned how to create a dream. Once you created a dream, how do you view it? The main way to view a dream is through the homepage. The homepage lists all the dreams you currently have recorded. Click on a dream's title or excerpt to visit the dream's page. Each dream has a unique dream page that contains all information about the dream. Here is how the a dream page looks like:

The dream page contains all the information you entered when creating a dream and is separated into two main sections:

1. **About My Dream**: Extra information regarding the dream such as characters and locations.
2. **The Dream Itself**: The dream's content.

The dream page also contains multiple options regarding the dream:

There are three options:
* **Back**: The first option featuring an arrow pointing to the left just brings you to the homepage if you click it.
* **Edit**: The second option featuring a pencil brings up a page to edit the dream's details.
* **Delete**: The third option featuring a trash can. When clicked, a prompt asking you if you want to delete the dream pops up.
