You may have made a mistake, or want to clarify something. The best way to do this is by editing a dream, or in rare cases deleting it. Dream Journal provides an easy way to do so.

#### Warning! After you approve deletion, there is no way to get a dream back!

In the previous article we learned how to view dreams and the different options while viewing a dream. To edit or delete a dream, go to the dream's page. The edit and delete options are both found on the top left corner of the dream's page:

## Editing a dream
1. Go to the dream you want to edit by clicking on it either from the home, search or filter page.
2. You should now be on the dream's page and see a pencil button on the top left corner of the page.
3. Click on the pencil icon.
4. An edit menu will show. Make any changes needed.
5. Click update once you are done with the edits.
6. The dream is now edited and updated.

The editor:

In the event that you accidentally click the blue left arrow (back button) while editing, a dialog box (as shown below) will pop up and ask you to confirm that you want to exit the editor.

## Deleting a dream
1. Go to the dream you want to delete.
2. Click on the trash bin icon located on the top left side of the dream page
3. A page will show asking you to confirm the delete action.
4. If you want to delete, press "yes, delete the dream". Otherwise, click "no".

If you accidentally click the trash icon, don't worry. The following page will show up to confirm deletion:
